Hello. I am an assistant professor in the Department of Korean Language and Literature at Korea University, in Seoul, South Korea. I received my PhD from the Department of Linguistics at the Ohio State University in June 2012. From August 2012 until May 2015 I was a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Second Language Studies at Indiana University Bloomington. My broad research interests are laboratory phonology, language acquisition, and Korean.
